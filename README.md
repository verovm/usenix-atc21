# Introduction

This repository contains all materials used for experiments in the paper:

**Yeonsoo Kim, Seongho Jeong, Kamil Jezek, Bernd Burgstaller, and Bernhard Scholz**: _An Off-The-Chain Execution Environment for Scalable Testing and Profiling of Smart Contracts_,  ATC Usenix 2021

These materials may be used for relplication studies, follow-up research, etc. The following sections contain information for three use cases from the paper. 

# Environment Preparation

All three use cases require pre-recorded substate database. This databse can be either generated by the recorder tool from the blockchain, or we provide a snapshot for download. 

## Generate Databse

TODO - @Yeonsoo, can you please write here how to generate the databse ?

## Pre-existing Database Snapshot

TODO - @Yeonsoo, can you write in the bracket the size of the download?)

Substate DB of 9M blocks: [gdrive download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jl6vdMea5ROKdrTUJUk8lh5NL48Do9xJ/view?usp=sharing)    (XX GB)

```
# untar substate DB
tar -xavf stage1-substate-0-9M.tar.zst
mv stage1-substate-0-9M stage1-substate
```

# Metrics

# Contract Fuzzer

This experiment provide results for paper Section 5.3 Fuzzer Use Case. This repository contais two variants of ContractFuzzer - an original version, and our fork that enables transaction replay. 

The experiment requires 
* the sub-state database, 
* contracs' ABIs, 
* addresses mapping   (TODO @Yeonso, can you add where and how to get this mappings)
* [NodeJS Installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), 
* [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

## Contracts' ABIs

The contract's ABIs can be obtained by the script:
```
cd ~/usenix-atc21/contract-fuzzer/substate-cf/contract_downloader/
./download_contracts.sh ~/address-to-substate/ ~/contracts 10
```
The parameters of the script tell (1) the directory with the addresses mappings (2) the output dir (3) the size of the batch, the ABIs will be grouped into - in the paper we have used 10. 

Notice that the script will try to download all available ABIs for the whole blockchain. It is possible to interrupt the script anytime earlier and continue the experiment on a smaller dataset. In the paper, we have dowloaed several tens of ABIs. 

## Build Docker Images

This repository contains docker images to simplify run of the experiments. Build the images by following commands:

```
cd ~/usenix-atc21/contract-fuzzer/original-cf/
docker build -t contractfuzzer-original-experiment .

cd ~/usenix-atc21/contract-fuzzer/substate-cf/
docker build -t contractfuzzer-experiment .

cd ~/usenix-atc21/contract-fuzzer/substate-cf/contract_experiments/
docker build -t cf-experiment-master  .
```

## Run the Experiment - Original Contract Fuzzer

Now the experiment may be triggered for the original contract fuzzer:
```
cd ~/usenix-atc21/contract-fuzzer/original-cf/contract_experiments/
```
Edit the ```docker-compose.yaml``` file via a text editor and update the following lines to contain correct paths on your system - absolute paths must be used (modify only the path before colon):
```
   - /opt/cf-experiments/contracts-original/:/contracts     # Directory with contracs's ABIs, must point to /absolute/path//usenix-atc21/contract-fuzzer/contracts-original
   - /opt/cf-experiments/address-to-substate/:/addresses    # Addresses mappings
   - /opt/cf-experiments/stage1-substate:/ContractFuzzer/stage1-substate/     # Substate database
```

The experiment may be now invoked via docker:
```
 docker swarm init
 docker stack deploy -c  docker-compose.yaml CF
 ```
 These commands run the experiment as docker services. 
 Now, periodically monitor logs, which will contain speed of executions, by using the following command: 
 ```
 docker service logs CF_master
 ```
 This will show for instance an output:
 ```
 CF_master.1  | Next task is 10 Index: 2/1165
 CF_master.1  | Speed:  diffTime: 4.0002, finishedTasks: 10, speed: 2.4998750062496873
 ```
 After some time of the experiment run, the value of the speed stabilises and it is used in the paper in Table 4: ContractFuzzer — performance improvements, first row.
 The running experiment may be interrupted by typing:
 ```
 docker stack rm CF
 ```
 ## Run the Experiment - Contract Fuzzer with Substate Reply
 
 To run the experiment, go to the directory 
 ```
 cd ~/usenix-atc21/contract-fuzzer/substate-cf/contract_experiments
 ```
 and repeat the same steps as in the previous experiments. Now the ContractFuzzer will use contracts data from the substate database via the Replay tool. 
 
 Edit the ```docker-compose.yaml``` file via a text editor and update again the paths (notice that the paths to contracts will be different than in the first experiment):
 
 ```
   - /opt/cf-experiments/contracts/:/contracts     # Directory with contracs's ABIs downloaded by the script above, must point to ABIs downloaded by the script /download_contracts.sh
   - /opt/cf-experiments/address-to-substate/:/addresses    # Addresses mappings
   - /opt/cf-experiments/stage1-substate:/ContractFuzzer/stage1-substate/     # Substate database 
```
 Furthermore, change the number of parallel executions. After each edit, run the experiment again. 
 
 ```
   deploy:
      replicas: 1    # Numner of parallel executions
 ```

The same as in the previous experiment, the speed is monitored and the results are used for Table 4: ContractFuzzer — performance improvements, second and next rows. The number of parallel tasks in the first column matches to the number of selected ```replicas```.

Notice that all replicas use the same sub-state database mounted via a file mount, and no testnet is needed.
