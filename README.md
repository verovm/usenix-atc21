# Introduction

This repository contains all materials used for experiments in the paper:

**Yeonsoo Kim, Seongho Jeong, Kamil Jezek, Bernd Burgstaller, and Bernhard Scholz**: _An Off-The-Chain Execution Environment for Scalable Testing and Profiling of Smart Contracts_,  ACT Usenix 2021

These materials may be used for relplication studies, follow-up research, etc. The following sections contain information for three use cases from the paper. 

# Environment Preparation

All three use cases require pre-recorded substate database. This databse can be either generated by the recorder tool from the blockchain, or we provide a snapshot for download. 

## Generate Databse

TODO - @Yeonsoo, can you please write here how to generate the databse ?

## Pre-existing Database Snapshot

TODO - @Yeonsoo, can you write in the bracket the size of the download?)

Substate DB of 9M blocks: [gdrive download](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jl6vdMea5ROKdrTUJUk8lh5NL48Do9xJ/view?usp=sharing)    (XX GB)

```
# untar substate DB
tar -xavf stage1-substate-0-9M.tar.zst
mv stage1-substate-0-9M stage1-substate
